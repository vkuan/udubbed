        <p class="lead">Ey there, friend. My name is Victor Kuan and I'm a second year CSE student at the University of Washington. My first year at the UW was a time of adventure, hardship, and confusion. I want to share some of the random findings/tips with some of you newer/prospective University of Washington students. Here it is: a silly little guide for you silly little babies.</p>

              <p class="lead" id="class-title">Psych210 - The Diversity of Human Sexuality</p>
              <p>Want to get 5 easy I&S/div credits while learning about sex? Take Psych210. It doesn’t get better than this. 
              You’ll learn about safe and acceptable ways to hookup, lose your virginity, and explore your kinks. Even more importantly, you’ll learn about STDs: its history, its causes, its frequencies, and its preventative counters. While you’re at it, you’ll learn about some sexual biology, the way our minds are wired to deal with sex, and much much more.
              So what’s psych 210? It’s an interesting, fun class that is notoriously easy to study for. There are 4 quizzes and some online homework. Additionally, the instructor (Nicole McNichols) is such a funny woman! She’s so knowledgeable and knows how to sneak witty sex jokes into her lectures. 
              17/10 would recommend that every UW student take this class at some point in their time here on campus.

              <p class="lead" id="class-title">Nutr200 - Nutrition For Today</p>
              <p>If you're anything like me, you've racked up a terrible college habit of eating ramen and junk food
                to save money and time, because you're a broke college student with shit to do. In Nutr200, you learn 
                all about the terrible consequences of abusing your body with such a terrible diet. You learn all about the
                different nutrients and supplements and different fats and vegetables you should be prioritizing and trying to 
                fit into your meals. Surprisingly, you also learn that some "junk-foods" or "fatty foods" are necessary and 
                totally alright to eat! Nutr200 will teach you about how to be a smarter and more efficient eater! If you care
                about your health and feel like learning about some pretty practical stuff while also getting 4 NW credits, 
                consider taking Nutr200! It's got a great reputation.
